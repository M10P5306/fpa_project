# Sir Drinkalot
A simple React drink recommendation tool using [CocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com) intended to help
party hosts select drinks to serve their guests. The application makes use of [react-custom-roulette](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-custom-roulette) to allow
the host to choose between drinks in a fun way. You can search drinks either by name, ingredients, or find new ones using the "I feel lucky" button.
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app), and [react-toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify) were used for the theming and interactive parts of the application. [react-router](https://reactrouter.com) was also used to make the page routable.
